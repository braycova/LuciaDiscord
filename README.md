# Lucia
**a discord bot disguised as a fancy cat**

Lucia is a self-hosted discord bot, with basic moderation, an economy, and some utility. As well as an occasional sprinkle of foolery.
You can find her commands listed through cog files or through `/help` interactive menu.

As this is an ongoing project, expect changes and bugs. Feedback is greatly appreciated. üç™
