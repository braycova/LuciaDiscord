# Lucia
**a discord bot disguised as a fancy cat**

Lucia is a self-hosted discord bot, prioritized in foolery, with some moderately useful functions. <br>
Her commands can be found listed through `/cog` files or through `/help` interactive menu.

As this is an ongoing project, feedback is greatly appreciated. üç™
